# Data-Analysis-Dashboard
I'm passionate about data analysis and love turning raw data into meaningful insights. My work involves data cleaning, exploration, statistical analysis, and creating visualizations using tools like Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI. I enjoy working with real-world datasets to uncover trends, solve problems, and support data-driven decisions.
